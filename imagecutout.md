# Image Cutout Service

This service exposes an HTTP-based API for image segmentation, based on the DeepCut library from Adobe Research. It generates a B/W mask which separates the foreground (e.g. persons, pets, etc.) out of the rest of the input image. The output is in PNG format for lossless and efficient encoding.

## API

`POST https://sensei.adobe.io/functions/image/imagecutout`

A B/W mask for a given image can be generated by sending JSON POST requests to `/functions/image/imagecutout` where:

* an `image` object provides either a URL string to the processed image, or a JSON object that presents the image

Example:

```json
{
  "image": {
    "uri": "https://cc-api-storage.adobe.io/id/urn:aaid:sc:abc",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
      "X-Api-Key": ""
    }
  }
}
```

On successful completion, the server returns a B/W mask in PNG format.
