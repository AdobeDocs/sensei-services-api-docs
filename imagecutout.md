# Image Cutout Service

This service exposes an HTTP-based API for image segmentation, based on the [DeepCut](https://git.corp.adobe.com/zlin/deepcut) library. It generates a B/W mask which separates the foreground (e.g. persons, pets, etc.) out of the rest of the input image. The output is in PNG format for lossless and efficient encoding.

## API

`POST /api/deepcutout`

A B/W mask for a given image can be generated by sending `multipart/form-data` POST requests to `/api/deepcutout` where a binary body part named `image` provides the raw image data.

On successful completion, the server returns a B/W mask in PNG format.

Example:

```
    POST http://localhost:8888/api/deepcutout HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------41184676334

    -----------------------------41184676334
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="test.jpg"
    Content-Type: image/jpeg

    [binary data]
    -----------------------------41184676334--

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: image/png

    [binary data]
```
